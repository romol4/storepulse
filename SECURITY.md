# Security policy

Storepulse holds API keys that can read a developer's sales data, so we treat
security reports as a priority.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **don't open a public issue**. Report it privately through GitHub:
**Security → Report a vulnerability** on this repository.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 3 working days. Please include:
- the affected version or commit
- steps to reproduce
- the impact you see

## Supported versions

Storepulse is pre-release. Only the latest commit on the default branch
receives fixes.

## What Storepulse promises about secrets

- **Where secrets are kept:**
  - The OS keychain, when one is available. Secrets too large for a keychain entry
    are AES-GCM encrypted into a file under a random key held in the keychain.
  - Otherwise a local file encrypted with AES-GCM, with a key derived from your
    passphrase using scrypt. Each entry is bound to its name.
- **Where secrets never go:**
  - `config.toml`, the SQLite database, raw report caches, or logs.
  - Log lines and error messages pass through a redaction filter.
- **Who Storepulse talks to:**
  - Apple and Google.
  - RevenueCat, only if you enable it.
  - Your own SMTP server.
  - No telemetry, no version checks.
- **What API keys it asks for:**
  - Setup guides request read-only roles only (Sales and Reports on Apple).
